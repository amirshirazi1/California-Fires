# Final Project - Part One
A shared repository for our final project_part one

## Presentation

#### Selected Topic 

- Impacts on birth rate? 
- Impact of past yearly rainfall on fire risk in the Napa Valley? What implications does this have for wine production in the area? 

#### Reason why they selected topic

 - Current decline in US population (birth rate )?
 - Current California drought and extreme fire season risk?


#### Description of their source of data

- Kaggle data set: Wine quality and yield per season/year 
- Rainfall trends, risk of fire

#### Questions they hope to answer with the data

1) Does prior yearly rainfall have an impact on the occurence/size/damage of wildfires in CA (particularly in Napa)?
2) Would wine makers be able to predict if a particular year's crop will be destroyed due to fires even before the fires happen?
3) What steps can wineries and wine makers take to protect their graps during a high fire danger season?

#### Technology

- See technology.md

## GitHub

#### Communication Protocols

1) Slack group chat will be used to share resources, ask questions and coordinate progress on deliverables.
2) The 7-9 pm PST workblock will be used for group working sessions
3) Main branch merge and weekly submissions will be coordinated by repository team member aligned with team established deadline.

#### Individual Branches & Commits (4)

## Machine Learning Model

Provisional Machine Learning Model that stands in for the final machine learning model.
- Takes in data from the provisional database
- Outputs label(s) for input data

#### Description & Explanation

- Which model did you choose and why?
- How are you training your model?
- What is the model's accuracy?
- How does this model work?

## Database

Provisional database that stands in for the final database.
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema 
- Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional database

#### Description & Explanation

- Create a document describing the schema of the database (this can be a markdown document or an ERD).
