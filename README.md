# Final Project - Part One
A shared repository for our final project_part one

## Presentation

#### Selected Topic 

- Impacts on birth rate? 
- Impact of past yearly rainfall on fire risk in the Napa Valley? What implications does this have for wine production in the area? 

#### Reason why they selected topic

 - Current decline in US population (birth rate )?
 - Current California drought and extreme fire season risk?


#### Description of their source of data

- Kaggle data set: Wine quality and yield per season/year 
- Rainfall trends, risk of fire

#### Questions they hope to answer with the data

1) Does prior yearly rainfall have an impact on the occurence/size/damage of wildfires in CA (particularly in Napa)?
2) Would wine makers be able to predict if a particular year's crop will be destroyed due to fires even before the fires happen?
3) What steps can wineries and wine makers take to protect their graps during a high fire danger season?

## GitHub
